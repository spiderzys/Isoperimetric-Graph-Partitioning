# Isoperimetric-Graph-Partitioning
An implementation of Isoperimetric Graph Partitioning

try to implement the work in 
Grady L, Schwartz E L. Isoperimetric graph partitioning for image segmentation[J]. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 2006 (3): 469-475.

 image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments. The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. 
 The work above uses the graph partition theorem in graph theory. This implementation follows the standard of minimun Isoperimetric Constant to generate boundaries of a digital graph.
